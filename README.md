# Laplace-distributed-noise
Technique to design private mechanisms for real-valued functions on sensitive data.

Adding controlled noise from predetermined distributions - a common technique to maintain privacy is to add noise to the results of queries. Some commonly used distributions for adding noise include Laplace and Gaussian distributions.
I have used laplace distribution here in this example.

Install Scikit-learn:
I have followed the following doc and it works.

Alternatively you can install Anaconda which offers scikit-learn:
Follow this :  https://teamtreehouse.com/library/installing-scikitlearn-using-anaconda

Either of these should be fine.
I developed and ran this module in Ubuntu and Fedora.

Knowing python is must.
